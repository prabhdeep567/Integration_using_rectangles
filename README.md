# Integration_using_rectangles
The Visualization of integration to find the area under curve by diving the curve in small rectangles and adding up their area, developed using Manim library in Python

These are some of my projects I developed using Manim for visualising some maths. This is for the area under curve of visualization for Reimann sums
under the equal width distributions.
